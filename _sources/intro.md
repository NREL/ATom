# Introduction to Acoustic Travel Time Tomography

Acoustic travel time tomography (AT) is an emerging remote sensing technique used to infer spatially and temporally varying fields of temperature and velocity by analyzing the propagation times of acoustic signals through the atmosphere. 
At NREL, we are developing AT for applications in the renewable energy R&D space to provide collocated high-resolution snapshots of velocity and temperature typically considered to be out-of-reach of other methods.

This book provides a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning and applying acoustic travel time tomography. It is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and advanced usage through a combination of reference materials, hands-on examples, and API documentation.

# In These Docs:
1. **Installation Guide**
   Standard approach to cloning the repo and installing from source.

2. **Theory Reference**  
   Mathematical and physical principles underlying acoustic tomography. This section provides a detailed discussion of signal travel time dependence on the mechanical and thermodynamic state of the atmosphere, the inverse problem, and techniques for reconstructing spatially varying fields from acoustic measurements.

3. **Interactive Examples**  
   Jupyter notebooks demonstrate key workflows ranging from signal processing tools through the ultimate retrieval of velocity and temperature fields. These examples include step-by-step instructions for reviewing measurement data, assembling large linear systems, analyzing real or synthetic data, and visualizing results. Readers are encouraged to modify and extend these examples to suit their needs.

4. **Python API Reference**  
   A detailed reference for the Python package accompanying this book. The API section documents the functions and classes necessary to implement and customize acoustic tomography workflows, including utilities for data preprocessing, inversion, and visualization.
